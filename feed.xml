&lt;p&gt;I attempted to share what I felt was a good cross-section of links and references which represent the evolution of my own views since &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/ren_r/260&quot;&gt;taking a similar course&lt;/a&gt; during my own time spent in university.  I suspect more robust references could be found within the walls of academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that what I shared will help give some students ideas on how to forge their own path in the world and find the courage to pursue their passion in a field as dynamic and complex as environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are asked to please be mindful that the contents of this presentation were delivered with an addtional oral explanation so there is potential to misinterpret the statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome respectful discussion on this and I recognize that some of the topics discussed inside may have alterantive explanations that are also valid.  Meanwhile I will also contend that there are plenty of messages and opinions that we (humanity) have adopted which give a comfortable position from which to continue our destructive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress has been made, but we still have lots of work ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions expressed in this presentation should not be considered as representative of the broader sunE team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entrepreneurship adventure of ours has had many highs and lows.  His speech has pulled me out of the depths of despair on more than one occasion.  What a great gift to humanity he has given by providing a living embodiment for the &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/next_generation.jpg&quot;&gt;Next Generation&lt;/a&gt; to tackle one of the biggest challenges of our time.  The team at sunE couldn’t be prouder to have been accepted onto this ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-without-further-ado-onto-the-story&quot;&gt;So without further ado, onto the story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is 2011, I had just won best presentation award at the 1st Student Research Symposium of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helmholtz-alberta.org/?page_id=109&quot;&gt;Helmholtz Alberta Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.  As the only undergaduate to participate in the event, how exciting it was to be recognized by such accomplished academics for my efforts in trying to understand the nature of the energy tucked away deep below our feet.  I asked of one of these men, the head of an experimental forest in Germany, what is my next step?  His answer was simple:
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/science_handout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Just put your hand out&quot; /&gt;
	“Just put your hand out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the answer I was looking for.  During my studies, I had formed the opinion that if we are going to solve climate change, it will be because we figured out how to make the business work.  Besides, I’d just graduated and spent the last couple months touring around southern British Columbia with one of my best buds Frankie (a master baker, painter and one of the most wonderfully caring souls you’ll ever meet).  I was in adventure mode and keen to bike down to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icenews.is/2011/10/23/geothermal-energy-conference-to-see-participation-from-islandsbanki/&quot;&gt;Geothermal Resources Convention&lt;/a&gt; in California.  With all the volcanoes along the way, I was super excited about all the new things I would discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had stars in my eyes, I was on cloud-9.  Before I left, I stopped in to see my buddy Frankie, he was not looking so good.  Now that summer was over, he didn’t know how we was gonna make ends meet and didn’t know who to turn to.  He asked for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I was, on one side, being given the opportunity to write my dream ticket.  On the other side, with a close friend desperately seeking a hand which I had no idea how to give.  But my bags were packed, I was hitting the road.  I cut the ballast, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I picked up a ‘commuter’ bike (I was on my way to find a job after all) and a bit of camping gear from Lethbridge, Alberta and hit the road.
This is the picture of my border crossing.  Of course, in earlier times, there was no border and this was known simply as Blackfoot territory.  But I was happy to give a salute to all 3 nations represented at the border that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/border.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Montana border crossing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaves and huckleberry pies of Montana in the autumn are a special treat that few know about.  The mountains aren’t as jagged as the peaks to the north in Canada, but the rivers wind through those valleys like the crispest ribbons of silk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than an hour across the border, BEAR!  BIG F-ING BEAR!  Biggest bloody grizzly bear I’ve ever seen in my life.  Bigger than most pickup trucks, I’m pretty sure with its paws stretched out, it would have spanned the entire 2-lane highway.  Less than 100 meters in front of me and my little commuter. This picture is not the actual bear by the way, I just found it on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/grizzly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BIG F-ING BEAR!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I grew up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-locations/british-columbia-canada.html&quot;&gt;Prince George&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve seen some big grizzly bears before.  But this was something else.  I didn’t even know they could get that big!!  But he didn’t stop, so he was gone as quickly as he appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On I went, into the Snake River Plane..volcano and ice cave territory.  I came upon a geology book with a fascinating theory.  That around 17 million years ago a meteor hit the crust so hard, that it cracked right down to the mantle and up came the volcanic hotspot we now know today as Yellowstone. 
Around the same time, Nevada stared stretching apart like a piece of taffy.  This created all sorts of volcanic goodies like hot springs, geothermal reservoirs and lithium deposits (a bit of gold and copper as well, if you’re into that sort of thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/nevada_rifting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nevada Rifting!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, that particular theory didn’t really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-19-me-477-story.html&quot;&gt;gain acceptance&lt;/a&gt; within the academic community to date.  I’m sure many alternate explanations are also very compelling, but that one has always stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada is a pretty rugged place.  Some like to joke that the only water around is boiling hot. It’s also a place for treasure hunters.  Probably one of the reasons the casinos felt so at home in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, after a night spent befriending a group of local bikers at Farpoint Station, I heard them calling out to me.  They were worried but relieved when I came from my camp.  They showed me all of the fresh mountain lion tracks around my bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/cougar_paw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My, what big claws you have!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that day on, I slept wearing my bike helmet, with bike chain around my neck, and buck knife in hand. Thankfully, I made it into California with no more feline encounters and time to spare.  I even got to hop in some top-notch natural hotsprings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/hot_spring.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Best bath ever!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, at the conference, pretty much everyone told me that I would need to go back to school to find a way into that industry.  I suppose that made sense.  But while speaking to the director of a major power company, I also received what I would now consider my first piece of executive advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t feel bad being a big fish in a small pond”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis mentor, Jacek also came out.  He told me about the great priviledge that comes from the attaining of a PhD and that I would probably benefit from the stability that universities can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/jacek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;me n Jacek&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then the trip was over, even if I wasn’t going to have my big break into the clean energy industry just yet, I was still supercharged from the experience and I was sure I would do it…somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flight back to Canada, I got a phone call.  Frankie was dead… Just like that, my world changed.  For all of the potential that I could look forward to, I had failed one of my closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/frankie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Frankie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide is a complex issue at the best of times.  Everybody will have their thoughts about what could have been done.  Family &amp;amp; friends will each have different memories. Warning signs. Silent cries for help. 
“Oh, what I would have done if only I’d known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, there cry for help was not silent.  It was the last conversation that I had with him.  I chose not to act and I will carry that with me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This achieving the centre - being grounded in one’s self - is about the highest state a human being can achieve” - Bruce Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we decided to move to the Philippines to start sunE, it was a near-instant decision and we really dived in head first without looking.  We rallied behind a vision to usher in a new era of transportation for a country that has grown accustomed to a reality that was due for replacement more than 50 years ago.  This was along with all of the pollution, discomfort and hidden costs (externalities, in economist speak) that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/launch_day.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Launch day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our first launch, people were delighted.  This was new, exciting and it improved quality of life in several ways beyond the quiet &amp;amp; ‘smokelessness’ of the vehicles themselves.  We were hitting our target numbers and people were feeling pretty optimistic about where we might go next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the experience of many early-stage entrepreneurs, I cannot think of a single time that somebody told me that what we are trying to accomplish is impossible.  As foreigners operating in a developing economy, it tends to sound more like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can’t make it work, there’s no hope for the rest of us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reflect on my life so far, my circumstances have been extrememly fortunate.  I have many talents and have always had plenty of access to opportunity.  The system works well for me.  So I work hard and generally I get good results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/gilbert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gilbert&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the modern era likes to promote itself as a champion of equal opportunity, Filipinos have become well-adjusted to a life lived on the margin of that system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankie’s roots were also much closer to the margin.  As much as he wanted to keep up with his friends (myself included) in their adventures, the cruel realities of his roots would show themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am again, in the middle to two worlds, to the left is the world that is keen to reward talent and usher in the future as fast as possible. To the right is a world full of people working hard just to keep their head above water and searching frantically for a lifeline.  As the waters rise, the number of frantic swimmers will be only increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pedal-power/maria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maria&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is through knowing our history that we have the best chance of ensuring that this transition we are undertaking will produce a truly better future. I won’t pretend that I know the solution but I am as committed as ever to keep fighting to make this solution work, whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Piccard is dreaming that humanity will rise to a new level, will trust the winds (and the weathermen) to take us out of the challenges of today.  It is people like him that help me to keep my eyes on the horizon.  To watch for the silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;

With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarimpulse.com/beyond-1000-solutions&quot;&gt;#beyond1000solutions&lt;/a&gt; campaign, Solar Impulse is gearing up to bring the forward the next wave of Cleantech into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the ball rolling for the next phase, I’ve put together a short list of some of the solutions getting developed across SE Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-broad-categories&quot;&gt;The broad categories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, SE Asia sits at 16 labelled solutions.  I’ve broken them down into 3 broad themes (I guess that makes me a lumper, not a splitter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labelled Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cleaning up our water&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Getting more efficient&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Better, Cleaner Mobility&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, some will contest my very crude categorizations.  I’d encourage them to also write an article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;by-country&quot;&gt;By country&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By country, it’s probably no surprise to anyone that Singapore leads the pack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labelled Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Singapore&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Philippines&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;South Korea&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Taiwan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Thailand&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the obvious bias that would come along with me trying to pick favourites within a group that our company is active in, I’m only going to talk about my picks from Category 1 &amp;amp; 2.  This article is going to be about water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would consider myself as a capable student of pollution solutions in general.  However, I claim no expertise or specialized knowledge in any of the technologies mentioned below.  I have not reviewed any information beyond what has been made publicy available on Solar Impulse and their own webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cleaning-up-our-water&quot;&gt;Cleaning up our water&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that global water resources are deteriorating.  This decline comes from various factors including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct chemical pollution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;micro-plastics overtaking fish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fertilizer and erosion runoff killing the world’s coastal ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We desperately need to improve our track record on hydro-externalities.  The 3 solutions below each endeavour to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-ecoworth&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecoworth-tech.com/&quot;&gt;EcoWorth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-impulse-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solarimpulse.com/efficient-solutions/carbon-fibre-aerogel-cfa&quot;&gt;Solar Impulse Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EcoWorth is targeting organics in wastewater.  Organics are a broad category which include most of the contaminants causing bad smells in most of the region’s urban lakes and waterways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of this technology, however, the ‘valuable organics’ that they are targeting appear to be some fom of spilled oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find the video a little hard to understand, but take note of the oily, yellow film on top of the water.  Absorbent pillows like these are often used in oil spills on the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_ctmxYjVgI&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the many pipelines and other oil-producing facilities across the world, these kinds of absorbent materials definitely have widespread demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term for a material that strongly repels water is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Cat’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Just kidding, it’s considered a ‘hydrophobic’ material and there are some great video demonstrations like this one out there in the cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls_ISb7lG-I&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-electro-contaminant-removal-system&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tridentwater.com.sg/&quot;&gt;Electro-contaminant removal system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;solar-impulse-page-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solarimpulse.com/efficient-solutions/electro-contaminant-removal-ecr-system&quot;&gt;Solar Impulse Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECR targets contaminated wastewater by applying electric fields which cause dissolved contaminants to lump together or coagulate (like your blood, when you get cut).  Today, this process is often done using chemicals called floculants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFlrfZK8ErU&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding chemical usage with this approach, is certainly attractive and I look forward to seeing more.
They are targetting phosphorus, even 10 years ago, concerns were being raised about phosphorus shortages in the coming decades.  Now that phosphorus has become a popular battery material, recovering the material from wastewater should be a high priority going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocean Plastics is a sector where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/waste-hierarchy-8-Eventually-the-higher-concepts-of-waste-management-such-as-3R-and_fig1_303369997&quot;&gt;Cleaner Production Pyramid&lt;/a&gt; plays a hugely important role.  The shear volume of plastics entering oceans every day is difficult to fathom.  To really make a dent on this issue will require solutions at every level of the pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/19x7ur_vCv0&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that collection/recovery, sits so low on the pyramid, they will probably be categorized as among the most expensive solutions. But that doesn’t mean it’s not necessary.  When PlakMan’s boats hit the water to start sucking up plastic, I hope careful thought will be  given to the location of their initial deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, I’m very happy to see new groups coming in to join the effort.  Humanity has had quite the party since first discovering plastics.  The cleanup job is substantial and many hands make lighter work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, some of my thoughts above have been helpful in looking at where we might go with these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you’re here, feel free to look around and learn more about our own solution.  You can check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarimpulse.com/efficient-solutions/sune&quot;&gt;Solar Impulse profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to see these projects continue to build steam as we move &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarimpulse.com/beyond-1000-solutions&quot;&gt;#beyond1000solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to have especially sensitive lungs as I come down with lung infections 2 to 3 times a year and it lingers for several weeks meanwhile nobody around me ever seems to get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough about that, the coronavirus has given people all sorts of reasons to pay more attention to their lungs in 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a thing for fractals and lungs are one of the famous examples of fractals that make an impact on our everyday life. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200308-1107OC&quot;&gt;One study estimated a whopping 480 million alveoli&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs of an average adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a diametre of 0.2mm across, you need 8 of them to provide 1mm^2 of oxygen:blood interface.  This gives me a total surface are of 60m^2.  While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reference.com/science/surface-area-human-lungs-ffc6ae1756c2f2e&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zwyfxfr/revision/4&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; yield 50 to 100 m^2; about the size of a tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hit those kinds of numbers from a structure that bifurcates (branches or splits into 2), you need 29 levels of branching.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016387791&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, this study models branching down to 23 levels&lt;/a&gt;.  My computer starts to seriously slow down around 12.  Poor little bugger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/dr-geo/&quot;&gt;Dr Geo&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty cool open-source geometry drawing program with a Smalltalk interface.  This is totally new territory for me but I was able to get a branching fractal to make a crude approximation of a lung structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a shot, windows users will probably need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview&quot;&gt;Ubuntu in Windows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sunE has been named by the Solar Impulse World Alliance as one of their 1000 efficient solutions. As part of the Solar Impulse World Alliance of Efficient Solutions, sunE will showcase our solution to innovators, investors and decision makers around the world. The official announcement will happen by solar impulse in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Solar Impulse organization is spearheaded by renowned Swiss explorer Betrand Piccard who flew around the world in a solar-powered plane without using a single drop of fossil fuel. He set out on that mission to prove that today’s clean technologies can compete with conventional fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/piccard-with-solar-impulse.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Capt Bertrand Piccard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piccard is bringing together 1000 of the world’s most promising clean technology innovations and connect them to investors, and leaders from around the globe. The Solar Impulse purpose is to bridge the gap between those building the solutions and the decision makers who will implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunE solution was assessed by a panel of international experts for its technological feasibility, environmental, socio-economic benefits, and economic profitability. We are proud to announce that we scored top marks in all 3 categories!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being selected as a Solar Impulse Solution is a great honour for sunE and a significant step onto the public stage.&lt;/p&gt;

They were reviewing the ASEAN zone and so I talked a bit about my experiences with entrepreneurship in SE Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the focus of the class, it was a good opportunity to summarize &amp;amp; synthesize some of the research I’d done on Public-Private Partnerships (P3) during the Smart Infrastructure Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

Around 20 Rotarians visited the Mangyan tribe in the Bansud Region of Mindoro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rotary/CLAP-2-768x576.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;CLAP Project distribution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is called Community Lighting and Iba Pa (CLAP) and it included donations of medical supplies, clothing, solar-lanterns, school-supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-trips&quot;&gt;Future Trips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already the group is making plans for future visits to additional villages in the area.  At that time, we at sunEtrike will also collect donations of SolarCoin as matched funds
SolarCoin Wallet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a limited scope proof-of-concept, we will provide a SolarCoin paper wallet to either Titser Annie or another more appropriate Community Representative.  The public are invited to donate their SolarCoins to this project at the address listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rotary/bansud-wallet-300x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bansud Wallet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: this wallet is no longer active or accepting donations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;redemption-of-the-coins&quot;&gt;Redemption of the Coins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be proposing a purchase of vitamins and other goods using SLR to selected vendors in the coming months.   The vendors would then redeem the coins for solar products/production on their own facilities/stores, etc.
